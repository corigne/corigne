Check out my site https://jodoin.io , just me tinkering with SvelteKit. Source [here](https://github.com/corigne/misfits/), but it's a slapdash project and not really worth looking at.
You can contact me at [via this mailto link](mailto:nathan@jodoin.io).

## Credits/Shoutouts

### On Formal Education

My Mom and Dad dropped out of college when I was born. They worked for a while to pay the bils until they started a software company, employing and enabling many of their friends.
They sold it just before the dotcom burst. Like many, we lost almost everything. We survived on my parents' hard work, but it was never the same afteward. The very same industry they had worked so hard to contribute to now looked down on them, despite their experience and skill.  

Why? They didn't have a degree; a simple piece of paper.  

Some of the most insightful, grounded, and intellectually gifted people I know have no degree or means by which to get one.
On the flip side, some of the most incapable, entitled, and outright evil peple I've met have formal educations.

Reconsider education as your bar for hiring. The current educational system generally benefits the wealthy over creativity, skill and character.
Higher education should be free for everyone who wants it, and until it is, hiring based on education enables that system.

Mom and Dad, thank you for struggling to give us chance. Without your support, I never would have pushed so hard to succeed.
